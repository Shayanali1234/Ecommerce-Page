# Ecommerce-Page

This repository showcases a basic e-commerce website landing page built with HTML5 for structure and CSS3 for styling.

Features:

    Product Display: Attractive presentation of products using images (attribution details provided below).
    Responsive Design: Adapts smoothly across various screen sizes,
    ensuring a seamless user experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
    Clean and Concise Code: Well-structured HTML and CSS code for readability and maintainability.



Customization:

    Product Information: Edit the HTML content to replace placeholder product information 
    with your own details (titles, descriptions, prices).
    Styling Adjustments: Modify the CSS file (styles.css) to tailor the visual design
    (colors, fonts, layouts) to match your preferences.
    Functionality Expansion (Optional): Consider adding basic functionality like a shopping cart
    or product details page using JavaScript in the future.

Feel free to contribute!

This is a basic project meant to be a learning foundation. You can enhance it further by adding more features,
